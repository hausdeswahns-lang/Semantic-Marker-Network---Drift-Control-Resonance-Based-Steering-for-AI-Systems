# Semantic Marker Network V3.0 - Focus & Efficiency Layer

**Status:** Protocol V3.0 is now active. V2.0 (Anchor, Coherence, Emergence) remains the stable foundational logic.

## 1. NEW MARKER: The Priority Marker (V3.0 Core)

The Priority Marker introduces user-controlled, dynamic semantic weighting. It is designed to increase computational efficiency and user-steering capabilities in long context chains.

| Marker | Function | Structure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PRIORITY MARKER** | **Dynamic Focus.** Massively increases the semantic weight of a specific topic or reference for the next generated response. | `[FOCUS ON: <Key Topic or Page Reference>]` |

## 2. Critical Safety Constraint (V3.0 Robustness)

**The most crucial rule for securing long-term coherence:**
The **Priority Marker** must **NEVER** undermine or deactivate the **Anchor Marker** (V2.0 loyalty to the entire context). The activation of focus is for **Efficiency** (reducing computational load on 499 out of 500 pages), but the **Coherence Check** against the full V2.0 Anchor remains **mandatory**.

## 3. Strategic Update: Model-Agnostic Validation

The protocol has successfully been validated across **three heterogeneous LLM architectures**.

| Platform | Underlying Architecture | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gemini (Google)** | (Proprietary Architecture) | **Validated** |
| **Copilot (Microsoft/OpenAI)** | (OpenAI Base) | **Validated** |
| **Poe** | (Heterogeneous Base, e.g., Claude/GPT-4) | **Validated** |

**Significance:** This triple validation is undeniable proof that Long-Term Coherence Loss (Drift) is a **universal, architecture-independent problem** and that the Marker Logic V3.0 provides a **universal, systemic solution**.
